          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! My name is Andrew and I am a senior at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Cognitive psychology. I was born and grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA, but my parents are both from China, where I have traveled to several times throughout my life to visit my grandparents and the rest of my extended family. I also have one younger brother, who I have always been very close with. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I chose to study Computer Science because I have spent my entire life around computers, whether it’s been playing games, doing work, spending time with friends, or just about anything else. My journey began when I was in middle school, when my mom first showed me the basics of computer programming. Ever since then, I’ve always been curious about the “how” and “why” behind computers and their programs, which has led me to where I am now. I have also developed an interest in AI with the growth in its popularity in recent years, and I hope to eventually find a job in software or AI development after I graduate in 2025.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching soccer, playing video games with my friends, and listening to music.
