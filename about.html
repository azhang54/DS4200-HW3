                <h2>Sports</h2>
                <p>
                    My favorite sport is soccer, though I enjoy playing and watching other sports such as basketball and American football. I have played soccer my entire life, including club in middle school, JV in high school, but not Varsity (due to injury). I also enjoy watching soccer with my brother and dad, and my current favorite teams are Man City in the Premier League, Barcelona in La Liga, Bayer Leverkusen in the Bundesliga, and Inter Miami in the MLS.

                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>
                    I love playing video games, and although itâ€™s hard to admit, I probably play an unhealthy amount of them. I have thousands of hours in several different games, with the most being in Dota 2, which I have played for 12 years and at a semi-professional level at my best. My favorite games are Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Escape from Tarkov, Minecraft, and Deadlock, though I cycle through games very often and have probably played hundreds of different ones.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    I enjoy listening to several different types of music in my free time. Currently, my favorite genres are Hip-Hop and R&B, and my top 5 artists right now are Kendrick Lamar, MF DOOM, Travis Scott, Joey Bada$$, and Metro Boomin.
